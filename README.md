# test-cases

This GitHub repository tends to solve 3 problems:
1. Changing the GitHub embedded education/autograding to satisfy the need of testing unusual cases that will happen when running student's homework code
2. Resolving the problem that timeout doesn't function as it should
3. Using a virtual machine that runs on the local machine instead of using the local machine itself or the vm that is provided by GitHub to prevent the breakdown from affecting
the local machine or the bill that is caused by using the vm provided by GitHub
